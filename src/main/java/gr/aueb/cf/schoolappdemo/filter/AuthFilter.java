/*Flow:
 * User goes to register page, does successful registration, so record to the DB
 * After registration goes to login page, and Login Controller raise a session with this username in Session Object
 * and redirect it to the teachers page
 * Then client will send another request to go to another page
 * So after login, every new request should be checked if there is a session active with this login
 * Every new request should be checked if there is state for that,  login has been done by filters (AuthFilter)/
 *
 * Client will receive a cookie (setCookie) and send another request (returning a JSESSIONID cookie too)
 * Every next request includes this JSESSIONID cookie, SO AuthFilter checks FOR every new request if this cookie exists
 *
 * AuthFilter checks if there is or not state for every request after successful login
 * There is ordering, chain
 * The order is configured into web.xml file
 *
 * //Middleware (node.js & csharp)
